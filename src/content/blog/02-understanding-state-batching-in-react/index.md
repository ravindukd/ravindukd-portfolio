# Understanding State Batching in React

React batches state updates to enhance performance, which can lead to issues where intermediate states are not visible if updates occur rapidly. Here’s a quick overview of how to address common mistakes related to state batching.

**The Issue**
State updates in React are batched, meaning only the final state might be visible, not the intermediate ones. This happens because multiple state updates are combined and processed together, leading to confusion if you expect to see each state transition.

**Why This Happens**
React combines multiple state updates within the same event loop to avoid unnecessary re-renders, causing only the last update to be shown.

**How to Fix It**

1. **Use a Single State Object:** Combine related states into one object to ensure they update together.
   
2. **Functional State Update:** Use a function that takes the previous state and returns an updated state object to ensure updates are based on the most recent state.

3. **Log Intermediate States:** For debugging, log state changes to confirm that updates are processed correctly.
