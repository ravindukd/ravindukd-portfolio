# Project IDX: Developing Flutter Apps in the Browser

Project IDX is a browser-based development environment that allows developers to build web and mobile apps, including Flutter projects, directly from their web browser. It eliminates the need for local setup by providing a clean, user-friendly interface with tools for code editing, debugging, and real-time emulation.

Key benefits of Project IDX include:
- **No Setup Required:** Everything runs in the browser, saving time and hassle.
- **Cross-Platform Development:** Supports web, Android, and iOS.
- **Real-Time Emulation:** Built-in emulators for instant testing.
- **AI Support:** AI tools assist with coding and streamline development.

However, being browser-based means reliance on internet connectivity, and it might not have all the features of a local environment for advanced projects.
